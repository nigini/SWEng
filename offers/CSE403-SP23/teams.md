## cumulative.do
This product will be a to do list web application mainly built through HTML, CSS, and Javascript that aims to collect assignment data from Canvas and course websites to automatically create and update a list of to dos for the user. The application will also allow a user to be able to add in other to do list items of their own choice. To-do list items will be displayed in chronological order of due date and will be crossed off from the list as the user checks off the tasks. The target audience of this product would be students at UW but can eventually be expanded to students in general.
